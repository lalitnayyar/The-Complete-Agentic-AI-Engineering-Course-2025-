# Banoffee Pie Recipe

## Ingredients
- 200g digestive biscuits or graham crackers
- 100g unsalted butter, melted
- 1 can (397g) sweetened condensed milk (for toffee)
- 3 ripe bananas
- 300ml whipping cream
- 2 tbsp icing sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- Dark chocolate or cocoa powder, for garnish

## Instructions
1. **Prepare the base**: Crush the biscuits into fine crumbs. Mix with melted butter until combined. Press the mixture firmly into the base of a 23cm (9-inch) pie dish. Chill in the fridge for 30 minutes.

2. **Make the toffee**: Boil the can of sweetened condensed milk in a pot of water for 2-3 hours. Make sure the can is fully submerged at all times, topping up water if needed. Alternatively, use ready-made dulce de leche. Let it cool.

3. **Assemble the pie**: Slice the bananas and arrange them evenly over the chilled biscuit base. Spread the toffee (dulce de leche) evenly over the bananas.

4. **Whip the cream**: Whip the cream with icing sugar and vanilla extract until soft peaks form. Spread the cream over the toffee layer.

5. **Garnish and serve**: Grate dark chocolate or dust cocoa powder over the cream. Chill for at least 1 hour before serving.
