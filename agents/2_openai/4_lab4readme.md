## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### 1. **Web Search Integration**
```python
# OpenAI's hosted web search tool
WebSearchTool(search_context_size="low")
```
- **Cost**: ~$0.025 per search (as noted in the lab)
- **Capability**: Real-time web search with AI summarization
- **Alternative**: Can be replaced with free search APIs

#### 2. **Structured Data Handling**
```python
class WebSearchItem(BaseModel):
    reason: str = Field(description="Why this search is important")
    query: str = Field(description="The search term to use")

class WebSearchPlan(BaseModel):
    searches: list[WebSearchItem] = Field(description="List of searches to perform")
```
- **Type Safety**: Ensures data integrity
- **Validation**: Automatic input validation
- **Documentation**: Self-documenting code

#### 3. **Asynchronous Processing**
```python
# Parallel search execution
tasks = [asyncio.create_task(search(item)) for item in search_plan.searches]
results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
```
- **Efficiency**: 3x faster than sequential processing
- **Scalability**: Can handle multiple searches simultaneously
- **Reliability**: Continues even if one search fails

#### 4. **Email Integration**
```python
@function_tool
def send_email(subject: str, html_body: str) -> Dict[str, str]:
    # SendGrid integration for professional email delivery
```
- **Professional Delivery**: Uses SendGrid for reliable email
- **HTML Formatting**: Rich, formatted reports
- **Delivery Confirmation**: Know when emails are sent

## üéÆ User Guide (How to Use)

### For Beginners

#### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment
1. **Install Required Packages**:

   pip install openai-agents sendgrid pydantic
   ```

2. **Get API Keys**:
   - OpenAI API key (for AI agents)
   - SendGrid API key (for email delivery)
   - Add keys to your `.env` file

#### Step 2: Run the Research
1. **Open the notebook** (`4_lab4.ipynb`)
2. **Change the research topic**:
   ```python
   query = "Your research topic here"
   ```
3. **Run all cells** in sequence
4. **Check your email** for the report!

#### Step 3: Customize Your Research

- **Update email addresses**: Change sender/recipient emails
- **Adjust report length**: Modify word count requirements

### For Advanced Users

#### Customizing Search Strategy
```python
# Modify the planning agent instructions
INSTRUCTIONS = f"You are a helpful research assistant. Given a query, come up with a set of web searches to perform to best answer the query. Output {HOW_MANY_SEARCHES} terms to query for."
```

#### Adding New Data Sources
```python
# Add custom search tools
@function_tool
def custom_search(query: str) -> str:
